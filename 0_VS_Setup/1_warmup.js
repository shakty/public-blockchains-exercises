//////////////////////////////////////
// Let's get familiar with VS Code. //

// Note: the code herein is relevant only for the editor Visual Studio Code.
// https://code.visualstudio.com/

// All the text that follows a double "slash", that is //, is a comment.
// Whatever follows the double slash on the same line is ignored by
// the computer, it is just for you to read.

// Empty lines are also ignore, obviously.

// Comments are perhaps the most important component in programming.
// What do programmers write in a comment?
// Imagine yourself opening this file in 2 years. What would you
// like to know in the most concise possible way?

// In these files, comments contain the instructions for the exercises
// as well as useful hints.

// I hope you don't get bored here. If so, just continue with the exercises
// in the next file at your own pace. You will find the solutions in the
// folder called solutions. Who would expect this?

// EXERCISE 1 Linting.
//////////////////////

// Linting can spot your code errors on the fly. As you type them.
// It can also gives you suggestions about how to better format and organize
// your code. Pretty useful, isn't it?

// But why this weird name? "Linting?" lint was the name originally given
// to a particular program that flagged some suspicious and non-portable
// constructs (likely to be bugs) in C language code.

// Below is some code with some errors and warnings. Below the error
// there should be a red line. If you hover over the line, you will
// get additional information about the error. In addition, all the
// errors are available in a separate panel at the bottom of the page
// (bottom left, look for an x inside a circle).

// Start fixing the first error, more errors might pop up, because the first
// error was blocking the execution of the code inspection
// (and of the auto-formatting).

// If you don't know how to fix an error, just comment out the line with //.
// However, for some errors you will find a link with additional
// information about how to fix them inside the tooltip, and for others you can
// simply click a "Fix" button.

// Fix the two errors below with a red-line underneath.

// a. Hint: follow the pattern.
variable1 = 1;
variable2 = 2;
variable3 = 3;

// b. Hint: This function needs a name after the word function.
function printHello() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}

// EXERCISE 2. Producticity: Shorcuts and More.
///////////////////////////////////////////////

// Proficient programmers use the mouse as little as possible, and try
// to do everything with the keyboard. It is actually possible to code
// without using the mouse at all, but we are still far from that point.
// Here we just learn a couple of useful tricks.

// a. Comment out useless code with Ctrl-/ Ctrl-/ (Linux/Windows)
// or Cmd-/ (Mac). Notice if you apply the command multiple times, it will
// uncomment/comment/uncomment... it.

uselessCode = 'I am useless';

// b. Cool. What other shorcuts are available? Here is a shortcut to find
// them all. Ctrl-Shift-P. Look around and remember how to get here,
// we will use it later.

// c. It would great if we could have a clone of ourselves, or even better
// multiple clones. It turns out that you can do it in VS Code! Highlight
// the word "not". Then press Ctrl-D (or Ctrl-Alt-Up/Down Arrow) as many times
// as needed to highlight all the next occurrences of the word "not". 
// At every word "not" there is a new cursor, so you can write multiple rows
// at once. Delete "not" and replace the exclamation mark with a sad face. 

catchMeIfYouCan1 = "You did catch me";
catchMeIfYouCan2 = "You did catch me";
catchMeIfYouCan3 = "You did catch me";

// d. Sometimes you want to move an entire line of code up or down. Of course
// there is a shortcut for that: Alt-ArrowUp/Down.

// Order the lines below accordingly.
console.log("1. I would like to go above.");
console.log("2. I would like to go below.");

// Great! To learn more about key bindings, see:
// - https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings

// EXERCISE 3 Indentation.
//////////////////////////

// a. Select all the code below and press the combination of keys to
// correctly indent your code. What combination? It depends on your
// operating system!

// To format the whole document:

// On Windows : Shift + Alt + F
// On Mac : Shift + Option + F
// On Linux : Ctrl + Shift + I

// Or check the keybindings link in the previous exercise to format only a
// portion of the code.

let a = 1234;
a++;
if (a > 123) {
  a--;
} else a++;
console.log(a);

// Nothing happened?
// If so, your code (technically my code, if you just cloned it)
// might have some errors. VS Code is a bit picky here, and
// does not touch code with errors. You will have to fix all the errors
// first and come back here. Do it, it's worthy.

// b. Can you grasp what the code is doing?

// EXERCISE 4. Bracket Matching.
////////////////////////////////

// JavaScript wraps blocks of codes in curly brackets: { SOME CODE }.

// A common rookie mistake is to forget to open or close a parenthesis,
// causing an error. Unfortunately, these common mistakes are surprisingly
// difficult to catch for the untrained eye and may cause acute distress
// in the joung JavaScript programmer. To prevent or mitigate this outcome,
// get familiar with the VS Code built-in "Bracket Matcher" utility.

// a. Position the cursor after the closing curly bracket of the following
// if statement (it is the last parenthesis). Does the opening curly
// bracket get highlighted?

if ((variable1 + variable2) > 1) {
  console.log("Hei!");
}

// b. That was easy. In more complicated cases, you might want to use a
// keyboard shortcut. Yes, but which one? You can search for "Go to bracket"
// in the menu of all VS Code commands. How do you open that menu? If you don't
// remember, go back to exercise 2.b.

// EXERCISE 5. Git.
///////////////////

// You made good progress. It is time to look back at when you started
// these exercises. You were a different person, and so this was a different
// file.

// a. Open the Git pane on the left (usually it is the third icon from the
// top, it should have a blue badge with a number on it).

// b. Visualize the changes in this file, and if you are happy with them
// your chages, "stage" them, i.e., add them to the git index.
// Note: in VS Code you may stage and commmit at once, so that is steps b.
// and c. together.

// c. Add a proper "commit" message to describe your changes. Be concise.
// Good to know: If you don't add a commit message directly in the commit form, 
// VS Code will open a new file in which you have to type the commit message:
// do it, save the file, and close it to execute the commit.

// d. Good! Your changes are saved. If you have the permissions, you will
// be able to push your code online, clicking on "Push Changes".
// If not, you might have cloned the main repo of the exercises, instead of
// your forked copy. May God have mercy on you.

// EXERCISE 6. Code Runner.
///////////////////////////
// This is the final obstacle between you and actual coding.

// You got to have the Code Runner extension installed.
// If you haven't done it yet, what are you waiting for then?
// Open the Extensions pane on the left (usually, fourth icon from the top) and
// search for "Code Runner". Install it.

// a. Try to execute the following code by highlighting it, and then
// pressing Ctrl-Alt-N. (You can also do, Right Click and then select the
// "Run Code" from the context menu).

let outcome = "Yes, I made it!";
console.log(outcome);

// b. Did it work? If so, try the following:

console.log("I want to say it 10 times:");
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i + 1 + ": " + outcome);
}
console.log("Mike drop.");

// Did you get this error:
// ReferenceError: outcome is not defined
// Code runner does not remember the code previously executed, so
// you need to highlight also the code that contains the definition of
// the variable outcome at 6.a.

// Congrats. You can now advance to the next exercises!
